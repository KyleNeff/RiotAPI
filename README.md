# Riot_API_Website

This website takes a SummonerName and uses an API call to get the users level, rank, and profile Icon. It also contains my 3 main accounts on the front page so I can access them quicker.

This is an extremely simple website and the main purpose was to understand React so I can use it more efficiently on a larger project.
