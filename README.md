# Riot_API_Website

This website is meant for people that play League of Legends and it allows them to search their summoner name and look at thier level and rank. It also contains my 3 main accounts on the front page so I can access them quicker.

This is an extremely simple website and the main purpose was to understand React so I can use it more efficiently on a larger project.
